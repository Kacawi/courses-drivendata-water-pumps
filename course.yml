author_field     : The DataCamp Team
description      : Interested in getting started putting your data science skills to work in order to solve some of the world's biggest social challenges? DrivenData provides that opportunity by hosting challenges where data scientists compete to come up with the best statistical model for difficult predictive problems that make a difference. In this practice challenge, you will be predicting which water pumps throughout Tanzania are functional, which need some repairs, and which do not work at all. You will predict one of these three classes based on a number of variables about what kind of pump it is, when it was installed, and how it is managed. A smart understanding of which waterpoints will fail can improve maintenance operations and ensure that clean, potable water is available to communities across Tanzania.
